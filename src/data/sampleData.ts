Your answers were great, though, and indeed on the systems I have tried the popcount() computation with the bit shifts you suggested is faster than using an 8 bit lookup table. (however the SSE4 popcnt (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SSE4#POPCNT_and_LZCNT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SSE4#POPCNT_and_LZCNT</a>) is  faster still).',
